<p style="text-align:center;">Although quotes, such as the one above, may seem cliche at first glace, a further examination into the impact of quotes on our daily lives reveals the significance of quotes and, at the very least, shows how quotes can be utlized to bring a smile to the reader's face
or a short pondering of whether or not a quote contains any truth. A good quote can really sell a literture piece or product. For example, a quote written by Albert Einstein sold in an auction house in Jerusalem for $1.56 million dollars. The quote was a one sentence
piece of advice on happy living stating "a calm and humble life will bring more happiness than the pursuit of success and the constant restlessness that comes with it." This illustrates the value of quotes whether it be moneytary or not. Furthermore, a second note from
Albert Einstein reading "where there's a will, there's a way" sold for $240,000. Besides moneytary value, quotes used in research papers or articles can effectively  and directly communicate an writier's idea in a way that an entire essay may fail to do so. Aside selling
quotes and utlizing them in a paper, quotes can be the fuel for motivation. Many people turn to quotes when they feel low on motivaton in hopes of seeing a quote that rekindles their motivation. We hope that in coding and creating this website, you can find quotes that bring a smile to your face or perhaps serve as a motivator.</p>
